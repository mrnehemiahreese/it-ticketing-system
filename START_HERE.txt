   - ASSESSMENT.md      → Current gaps and improvement plan

2. UNDERSTAND STATUS (5 minutes):
   - INDEX.md          → Documentation navigation guide
   - PROGRESS.md       → What work is planned and in what order

3. LEARN CONVENTIONS (5 minutes):
   - CLAUDE.md         → How we code, test, and work together

4. SETUP LOCAL ENVIRONMENT (5 minutes):

KEY INFORMATION AT A GLANCE
================================================================================

PROJECT STATUS:        45% Ready (Early Development)
CURRENT PHASE:         In Planning (No phases started yet)

CRITICAL GAPS:
  - 0% Test Coverage    (Phase 1: Weeks 1-2)
  - Security Issues     (Phase 2: Weeks 2-3)

CRITICAL INFORMATION
================================================================================

BEFORE STARTING WORK:
  ✓ Understand the 6 critical issues (see ASSESSMENT.md)
  ✓ Know the phase dependencies (see PROGRESS.md)
  ✓ Follow code conventions (see CLAUDE.md)
  ✓ Review architectural decisions (see DECISIONS.md)

BEFORE PUSHING TO PRODUCTION:
  ✓ Complete all 7 phases
  ✓ Achieve 80%+ test coverage
  ✓ Pass security audit
  ✓ Load test at 1000 concurrent users
  ✓ Configure monitoring and alerting

IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS:
  1. Set up testing infrastructure (Phase 1) - START THIS WEEK
  2. Fix JWT secret enforcement (Phase 2) - START THIS WEEK
  3. Add rate limiting (Phase 2) - START THIS WEEK

================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

- Project is very new (3 git commits)
- Architecture is solid (85%) but has critical gaps
- Testing is completely missing (0%) - PRIORITY 1
- Security needs hardening before any external deployment
- Database migrations not yet implemented
- Code has anti-patterns emerging (backup files, console.log)

The documentation you have now represents a comprehensive assessment of
the project's current state and a detailed plan to reach production
readiness in 6 weeks. Use these documents to guide your work.
